# Angular Binding High Volume Data

The Angular financial chart component is capable of handling high volumes of data. The following demo binds 20 years of data, with 1 hour intervals and displays the stock prices using line chart type.

## Angular Binding High Volume Data Example

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 500px">
    <iframe id="financial-chart-high-volume-iframe" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/financial-chart-high-volume' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Binding High Volume Data Example"></iframe>
</div>
<div>
    <button data-localize="stackblitz" disabled class="stackblitz-btn"   data-iframe-id="financial-chart-high-volume-iframe" data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}">View on StackBlitz
    </button>


</div>

There are several chart features and Angular specific features that affect performance of the chart and they should be considered when optimizing performance in your application.

When storing lots of data in properties in your components to bind against, you should make sure to set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in your `@Component` decorator. Setting this will tell Angular not to dig deeply into changes within your data array, something you don't want Angular doing every change detection cycle.

The following code demonstrates how to bind the financial chart to high volumes of data.

```ts
import { GenerateHourlyPricesService } from "../services/generate-hourly-prices.service";

export class AppComponent {
    public data: any;

    constructor(private dataService: GenerateHourlyPricesService) {
        const dateEnd = new Date(2018, 3, 20); // April 20, 2018
        const dateStart = new Date(1998, 3, 20); // April 20, 1998
        this.data = this.dataService.GetStockHistoryBetween(dateStart, dateEnd);
    }
}
```

```html
 <igx-financial-chart
    [dataSource]="data"
    width="850px"
    height="600px">
 </igx-financial-chart>
```
